# blockchain-wallet
This is angular basic blockchain wallet application

My first approach for developing this application is to make archiecture/things simple. As mentioned, the architecture style is atomic design pattern.
The application contains one significant component "wallet" and other molecular components inside shared folder.

I have used angular material, flat icons, mat-table, mat-input, mat-select
